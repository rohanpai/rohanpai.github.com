<p>Yuval Noah Harari</p>
<p>
Sapiens is the most important book I have ever read. Sapiens aims to understand why the world is the way it is. Not because history repeats itself, but because if we understand the past we can liberate ourselves from the realities created for us and imagine the new.

<p>James P. Womack, Daniel T. Jones, Daniel Roo</p>

<p>Machine that Changed the World is a book written in the early 90s  by a few MIT Sloan Researches on how Toyota changed manufacturing by inventing Lean Manufacturing. Automobiles are interesting since it's one of the most expensive object most people will ever purchase. Moreover, the automobile manufacturing is hidden from the consumer despite being the single most important process for making and breaking players in the space.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nike-Culture-Swoosh-Cultural-Icons/dp/0761961496" target="_blank"><img class="book" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41UGQ2azQgL._SX410_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" width="122"></a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nike-Culture-Swoosh-Cultural-Icons/dp/0761961496">Nike Culture: The Sign of the Swoosh</a></h3><p>Robert Goldman</p>
<p>Nike Culture was my first introduction to Critical Theory — the act of taking a real world object or idea and deconstructing its history through philosophical lenses. The book challenged me to become more inquisitive about the relationship between people and symbols — and the effect that these have on sociology, marketing, and business more generally.</p>

<p>Thomas M. Sterner</p>

<p>Practicing Mind was my first exposure to mindfulness — a habit that eventually fueled my interest in meditation not too long after reading this book. Process over product. We live a significant portion of our lives in autopilot mode. When things don't go our way, many of us get frustrated or attribute our inabilities to factors that are outside of our control. Practicing Mind is a practical introduction to “present moment awareness” and “non-judgemental observation.”</p>
