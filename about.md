Ahoy!

My name is Rohan Pai and I'm a student at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science. I enjoy reading books and old magazines, meeting interesting people, and building things. I'm primarily interested in learning more about technology, business, biology, and  human history. While in high school I worked at Apple Inc. and have spent a summer at the Tesla Factory in Fremont and a summer at Sourcegraph.

This website exists because I have found writing to be a great way to refine my thinking and force myself to reflect. Critical feedback is much appreciated â€” that's how I can improve!
