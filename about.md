<p>I'm a student at University of California at Berkeley studying computer science. In high school, I worked for Apple. I spent summers in college at Tesla Motors, Sourcegraph, and the Icahn Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology (HammerLab).</p>

<p>Outside of school and work, I enjoy reading, performing stand up comedy, and traveling.</p>
