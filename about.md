<p>I'm a student at University of California at Berkeley studying computer science. In high school, I participated in many hackathons and worked at Apple on <a href="http://icloud.com">iCloud</a>. I spent summers in college at Tesla Motors, Sourcegraph, and the Icahn Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology (HammerLab).</p>

<p>Outside of school and work, I enjoy reading, performing stand up comedy, and traveling.</p>
