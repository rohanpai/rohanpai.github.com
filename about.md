<p>In high school, I participated in many hackathons and worked at Apple on <a href="http://icloud.com">iCloud</a>. I left Apple to study Computer Science at UC Berkeley. I spent summers in college at Tesla Motors, Sourcegraph, and the Icahn Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology (HammerLab).</p>

<p>Some things I work on:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://venturefolder.com">VentureFolder</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://insecureclothing.com">InsecureClothing</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://applied.co">Applied Intuition</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Outside of school and work, I enjoy reading, performing stand up comedy, and traveling.</p>
