Hello! My name is Rohan Pai and I'm a student at UC Berkeley where I'm studying computer science and also learning a lot about anthropology. 

In my free time I enjoy reading books, spending time with great people, and visiting new places.

<li>- <a href="http://www.greylock.com/greylock-u/hackfest/">Greylock Hackfest 2015</a> - Winner</li>
