I"3<p>Hi</p>

<p>I'm Rohan. I'm from California. </p>

<p>In high school, I worked at <a href="https://applied.com">Apple</a> on <a href="http://icloud.com">iCloud</a>. I left Apple to study Computer Science at The University of California, Berkeley. During college, I worked at <a href="https://tesla.com">Tesla Motors</a>, <a href="https://sourcegraph.com">Sourcegraph</a>, and <a href="https://hammerlab.org">HammerLab</a>.</p>

<p>
Now, I'm at <a href="https://applied.co">Applied Intuition</a>. Applied is building tools and products that accelerate the development and testing of safe autonomy.</p>

<p>Most recently, I helped lead our APAC expansion from Tokyo, Japan and am now working as Chief of Staff.
</p>

<p>I also enjoy reading, listening to records, taking film photos, and performing stand up comedy.</p>
