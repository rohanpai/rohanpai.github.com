Today I stepped in a pile of shit while walking to class. I'm not being metaphorical. Some asshole didn't clean up his dog's shit in the middle of the sidewalk this morning so it ended up on one of my favorite pairs of shoes.

Here's the surprising thing: it didn't bother me at all. I proceeded to walk down the street and wipe off what I could using a couple Daily Cal newspapers conveniently located nearby. And my day went on.

Being bothered by something is a choice. Who was I supposed to get mad at anyway? Some asshole I never met and likely never will? Myself for being absentminded? Getting upset doesn't change the fact that there's still shit on my shoes.

I'm not saying don't be bothered by things. Being bothered by things is good. It means you care about something. My point is that being bothered is a finite resource. Spend it on things that matter. Spend it on people that matter. Choose wisely because the rest of the shit doesn't matter.
