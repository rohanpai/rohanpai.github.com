As it currently stands, Batman Begins is one of my favorite films of all time. Every time I watch it, I find myself understanding and connecting with the film in deeper ways.

One of my favorite scenes in the movie is when Bruce Wayne climbs a mountain to train with Henri Ducard and the League of Shadows.

> Henri Ducard: Are you ready to begin? 
> Bruce Wayne: I-I can barely stand... 
> Henri Ducard: [kicks him] Death does not wait for you to be ready! Death is not considerate, or fair! And make no mistake: here, you face Death. 

This scene speaks strongly about the nature of things.

# Motivation and Training:

Some of us have strong images in our minds of the kinds of people we want to be and the kinds of things we want to achieve. What separates us from the person in our mind is the the amount of work we put in and the relentless drive to make it a reality.

Some of us have it harder in some ways than others. The world is not "considerate, or fair." 

The world is indifferent to your desires, goals, feelings, motivation, and excuses.

If you actions are based on how motivated you feel moment to moment, you are unlikely get closer to the ideal. You might even change what it is you're working towards. In other words, you'll make excuses. 

If your actions are independent of your moment to moment motivation, you'll realize it's necessary to put in the work, even when you don't feel like it, after all, the world does not wait for you to be ready. And here, your life will pass you by.
