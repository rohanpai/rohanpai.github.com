The books mentioned below came out this year and are excellent notes on the following topics: coming up with original ideas, developing a work ethic that produces fantastic results, and some fields showing promising future growth.

## 1. [Originals by Adam Grant](http://www.amazon.com/Originals-How-Non-Conformists-Move-World/dp/0525429565/)

**Originals by Adam Grant**. Grant is the youngest tenured and most highly rated professor at the Wharton at UPenn.

**Here’s why I recommend Originals:**

* Brining an idea to fruition is a great feeling. Grant transforms the art of creativity into a science. 
* A lot of interesting anecdotes 

**Key Takeaways** 

* People who come up with good ideas come up with a lot of ideas. Most are bad but that’s okay. It’s the good ones that count. 
* There’s an Einstein quote that goes something like “If at first the idea is not absurd, then there is no hope for it.” While there’s some truth to the notion of absurd ideas being good ideas, it isn’t always helpful to your mission to stress the absurdness of it. 
*  Expose yourself to many fields. You’ll see connections among seemingly different domains.


**Some other stuff by Adam Grant that I like**

* [Can we end the Meditation Madness](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/10/opinion/can-we-end-the-meditation-madness.html)

## 2. [Deep Work by Cal Newport](http://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/145558669)

Wonder how Adam Grant is so effective with his time? Grant’s work ethic is conveniently covered in **Deep Work by Cal Newport**. Newport is an assistant professor of Computer Science at Georgetown University. I’ve been following Newport’s blog StudyHacks since early high school and his latest book is an excellent.

Here’s why I recommend Deep Work: You spend many hours a day working. So many variables in life are depend on the work you do: happiness, comfort, life flexibility, and meaning. The way I see it, it makes sense to invest the time to think and plan how you want to work and the kinds of skills you want to optimize for.

**Key Takeaways from Deep Work**

* Working more isn’t working better.
* People with rare and valuable skills are highly sought after by the economy. Engaging in high intensity distraction free work sessions with the intention of deliberately pushing one’s understanding of a topic enables one to aquire rare and valuable skills effectively.  
* Letting network tools, such as Facebook, Twitter, E-Mail capture your attention clutters your mind. It increases the friction to achieve depth in work and understanding. As a result, it makes it harder to acquire rare and valuable skills.
* You don’t need to sacrifice other parts of your life to do high quality work. In fact, if you do sacrafice other parts of your life, you’re probably working wrong.  In other words, “work hard, play hard”
* 4 hours of concentration free/high intensity is pretty much the upper limit for humans. 

**Some other stuff by Cal Newport that I like:**

* So Good they Can’t Ignore You by Cal Newport 
* [Knowledge Workers Are Bad at Working](http://calnewport.com/blog/2012/11/21/knowledge-workers-are-bad-at-working-and-heres-what-to-do-about-it/)
* [Deep Habits](http://calnewport.com/blog/2013/12/21/deep-habits-the-importance-of-planning-every-minute-of-your-work-day/)

## [3. Industries of the Future by Alec Ross](http://www.amazon.com/The-Industries-Future-Alec-Ross/dp/1476753652)

So we’ve covered coming up with original ideas and doing excellent work, but what should one work on? Industries of the Future by Alec Ross is one of the best collections I have read regarding the future of technology. I’m typically not a fan of literature on the future of world, it usually devolves into some sort of unproductive monologue with one’s philosophical views unnecessarily baked into the crust. This is not Ross’ book.

**Here’s why I recommend Industries of the Future**

* It’s sensible to plan your present day actions based on where the world is going in the future. **Industries of the Future** highlights a lot of areas that show promise based on technology that exists today.
* If you are a college student unsure of what you want to do with your life, I would highly recommend this. Brings to light a lot of problems you can spend a lifetime on.

**Key Industries of the future**

* Robotics 
* Genomics
* Electronic money and credit for the developing world 
* Weaponization of code
* Larger collections and analysis of data
* Geographically where markets will be
