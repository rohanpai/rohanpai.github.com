Yesterday night I was reading about Fredric Baur [Fredric Baur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Baur) a chemist at Procter & Gamble. In the late 1960s, P&G tasked Baur with the challenge of "creating a perfect chip to address consumer complaints about broken, greasy, and stale chips, as well as air in the bags." 

Baur's creation is known today as Pringles. The iconic chip of questionable potato content is testament to the power of simplicity and uniformity. In a sense, Pringles are the Lego of the snack food world.

What I found especially interesting about Baur's life is the symbolic nature of his burial. Baur requested that at his death his ashes should be buried in a Can of Pringles. He was literally buried in his life's work. As Baur rests in a can of Original flavored Pringles his work lives on.
